# HTML Testing Area
In this repository I will incorporate much if not all of my html, css and js knowledge.
I will upload different versions of this repository to show my progress in these markup languages.
I'm writing this text file while I am in my second year of my programming school.
We have just started writing html code.
## Code examples V (0.1)
So the first html bit which will be the first html to open is this.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hallo Welt!</title>
    </head>
    <body style="background-color: greenyellow;">
        <h1>This is my new Website.</h1>
        <a href="luigi_hit.html">
            <img src="https://c.tenor.com/CA3OIwcuiZ0AAAAi/luigi-baby-luigi.gif" width="150" height="150">
        </a>
        <p>
            <em style="font-size: x-large;">You should try talking to luigi!</em>
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```
