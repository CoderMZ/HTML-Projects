## Code examples V(0.1)
So the first HTML file which will be the first html to open is here.
We can call this the main Website.
It's just a quick little thing I did in class when we made our first website.
So what you can do on here is so limited, that you can literally just click the picture
and then be linked to the second page.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hallo Welt!</title>
    </head>
    <body style="background-color: greenyellow;">
        <h1>This is my new Website.</h1>
        <a href="luigi_hit.html">
            <img src="[image link here]" width="150" height="150">
        </a>
        <p>
            <em style="font-size: x-large;">You should try talking to luigi!</em>
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```
This is a side page, which will be linked to from the first page through the picture.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>NOBODY HITS LUIGI</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <img style="border: 10px solid darkred;" width="1000" height="800" src="[image link here]">
    </body>
</html>
<style>
    body {background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);}
</style>
```
